# FAMNMS Website
## October CMS Edition

This repository contains source for the custom theme and plugins developed
for the FAMNMS website. It does not contain sources for the frontend pages
within the FAMNMS website, as those are environment specific and not best
suited for a Git repository.

### FAMNMS-2019 Theme
Based on Bootstrap 3 (soon to be Semantic UI) and Flat UI. Customized to use
a dark theme.

### Plugins
#### Members
Handles members of FAMNMS, including personal information. This is extended
in other plugins to add functionality

#### Events
Handles events at FAMNMS. Capable of tracking registrations and attendance.
Members can register for an event using their frontend account and can mark
themselves as in attendance using a code given at an event. Both of these
actions can also be performed by the leadership team in the backend.
